# Tata AI Architecture

Tata AI consists of four primary modules: Tata-CORE, Tata-MEMEX, Tata-ZKP, and Tata-FLOW. Each module is containerized using Docker and communicates over a secure network.

The core components interact with each other via HTTP APIs and support dynamic resource management using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
